# Perplexity Clone

This is a perplexity clone. It uses Claude, but any LLM provider can work.

Missing features:

- Crawling of the content of the search result links, and then giving it to Claude to ingest. I am currently only giving Claude a sample of the content.
- Authentication.
- Multiple prompts (hold a conversation based on the search results).
